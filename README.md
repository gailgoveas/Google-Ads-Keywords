## Project Title: Enhanced Keyword Generation for SEM Campaigns

### Introduction
This project presents a Python-based approach to generate enhanced keywords for Search Engine Marketing (SEM) campaigns, specifically tailored for budget-conscious furniture retailers. The goal is to develop keywords that are not only cost-effective but also resonate with the promotional strategies and search behaviors of the target customers.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Creating Keywords:**
   - Combines action-oriented and value-driven words with product names to create a comprehensive list of potential search terms.
   - The process starts with basic terms associated with purchasing intent such as 'buy', 'price', 'discount', leading to combinations like 'buy sofas', 'sofa discount', etc.

2. **Conversion to DataFrame:**
   - The generated keyword list is then structured into a pandas DataFrame to facilitate data manipulation.
   - Columns are appropriately named, e.g., 'Ad Group' and 'Keyword', and additional attributes like 'Campaign' and 'Criterion Type' are introduced to provide context and detail.

3. **Optimizing Keyword Match Types:**
   - The notebook explores the transition of keywords from 'Exact' match to 'Phrase' match, highlighting the advantages of each approach in SEM.
   - This section also discusses the implications of match type selection on campaign visibility and budget efficiency.

4. **Saving and Exporting:**
   - The final list of keywords is saved into a CSV file, which can be directly imported into AdWords or BingAds editors for campaign setup.
